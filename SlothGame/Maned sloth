Maned sloth
3 toed 

Anatomy and morphology

	Maned sloths have a pale brown to gray pelage. 
	Long outer hair covers a short, dense, black and white underfur. 
	The maned sloth's small head features fur-covered pinnae and anterior oriented eyes that are usually covered by a mask of black hair. The sides of the maned sloth's face and neck feature long hair covering the short hair of the sloth's snout. Facial vibrissae on the maned sloth are sparse.[6] 
	The maned sloth earns its name from a mane of black hair running down its neck and over its shoulders.[4] 
	The mane is usually larger and darker in males than in females, and in the latter, may be reduced to a pair of long tufts.

		tail about (2.0 in) long
		weight of (8.8 to 17 lb)
	Females are generally larger

Ecology and behavior

Maned sloths are folivores, 
	feed exclusively on tree and liana leaves, especially Cecropia. 
	individual animals seem to prefer leaves from particular species of tree
	able to adapt to a wide range of tree types.[7] 

Younger leaves are preferred to older,
tree leaves are preferred to liana leaves.[10] 
main defenses are to stay still and to lash out with its formidable claws. 
It can swim well.

Life history
babies weighs around 300 grams (11 oz) and lacks the distinctive mane found on adults. T
take solid food at two weeks, 
fully weaned by two to four months of age.[13] 
The young leave the mother at between nine and eleven months of age.
