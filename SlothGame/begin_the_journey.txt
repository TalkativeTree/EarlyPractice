Hey there friend? Or should I say "Hello their conspirator!" Whatever it is you are in relation to my existence... 	
	(I'm a program so does this mean we're in Tron, but instead of Jeff Bridges we 	have Jeff Goldblum and a giant man-eating sloth instead of a T-rex?)
let me officially welcome you to Sloth Wars! 

Unlike it's name, this isn't a violent game...yet. In this game you'll get to birth a sloth 
	(hopefully not figuratively. We only talk in literals on this island 
		{we're on an island?
			[is this Lost?]
			}
			) #why are these separate? Must be loners...
and raise it as your own. You of course have many options of raising a sloth with three toes or a sloth with three toes.
	"But TalkativeTree...I...I wanna raise a two-toed sloth :("

I understand Billy, but all sloths have three toes. Two-toed sloths have two fingers :P. Anyway, we're walking down a tangent. 

The only thing you need to know is that if at any point you need help. Use Google. Or typing in "Menu". If you ever type in Menu, it will bring up a list of things that you are able to do at that given point. 

Currently, this game is in development. I will add features as I get to them and information as requested. For now, I want you to experiment and see what happens. This is the most exciting point of a game, because no one has spoiled it for you. You get to be the person climbing Mount Killamanslothbro. 
	
	(that's Kill-a-man-Sloth-bro if you didn't catch that. See that was funny, because I took Mt. Kilimanjaro...frack it.)

IT
IS
TIME
TO
MAKE
YOUR
SLOTH BABY
