2 Toed vs 3 Toed themes

Three-toed sloths have nine vertebrae, they have a small tail, and their forelegs are substantially longer than the rear ones, while two-toed sloths have six or seven vertebrae, they do not have tails, and their front and back limbs are closer to the same size.

biters

Slothra vs Mega Sloth

evolve into slothra if you accumulate enough moths
sloths with moths
	pale-throated
	brown Three-toed
	Linnaeus' two-toed
evolve into Mega Sloth if you hit a certain size && strength

Anthropods
The large variety of arthropods associated with sloths comprise two distinct #{feeding guilds} â€“ the haematophagous guild, represented by @biting_flies and @ticks, and the #{coprophagous guild} which comprises a unique assemblage of @moths, @beetles and @mites which utilize the sloth principally for phoresis and whose larval stages feed and develop in the dung of the host sloth.

Haematophagous guild
blood suckers #if levels get too high, cause illness and weakness

ticks (almost all sloths have them. 99% of 3 toed, 80% of 2 toed)
biting flies
mites

Coprophagia guild
poop breeders
	depend on sloth poop to place larvae
feed off algae
	more algae => more moths/beetles

moths #associated with Mothra
number of moths more dependent on amount of algae

beetles #associated with megasloth =>strength
	very large populations within sloths
	mostly 3 toed sloths :(
	more dependent of types/size of poop
